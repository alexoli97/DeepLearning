# Lab 4 - Deep Learning with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs

## Overview
Lab 4 explores Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically focusing on learning sequences and understanding the internal structure of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. The lab includes theoretical discussions and practical exercises, highlighted in the provided Colab Notebooks.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Neural Networks, RNNs, and LSTMs.
- Familiarity with Python and TensorFlow.

## Theory Part

### 1. Learning Sequences with RNNs
- **Objective**: Understand the structure and functionality of RNNs for sequence learning.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Calculation of RNN parameters for different time steps.
  - Impact of increasing time steps on parameter count.
  - Challenges in learning long-term dependencies.

### 2. Deep Dive into LSTMs
- **Objective**: Explore LSTMs, their gates, and how they address challenges in RNNs.
- **Key Topics**:
  - The motivation behind using gates in LSTMs.
  - Handling of vanishing gradient problem by LSTMs.
  - Variants of RNNs and brief explanations for each.

## Practical Part
The Colab Notebooks contain code for implementing RNNs and LSTMs on datasets.

### Key Steps:
1. Build and train RNN and LSTM models.
2. Analyze the performance and effectiveness of these models.
3. Visualize and interpret the results.
