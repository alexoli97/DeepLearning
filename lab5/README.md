# Lab 5 - Exploring Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview
Lab 5 delves into the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), emphasizing their structure, functionality, and applications. The lab combines theoretical analysis and practical exercises, as detailed in the provided documents and Colab Notebooks.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of neural networks and GANs.
- Familiarity with Python, TensorFlow, and machine learning concepts.

## Theory Part

### 1. Understanding GANs
- **Objective**: Analyze the concept and hype surrounding GANs.
- **Key Topics**:
  - GANs architecture and objective functions.
  - Challenges faced during GAN training.
  - Methods to evaluate GANs performance.

### 2. Detailed Analysis of GAN Components
- **Objective**: Gain in-depth knowledge of GAN components.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - The role and functioning of the Generator and Discriminator.
  - Mathematical formulation of GAN objective functions.
  - Potential problems and solutions in GAN training.

## Practical Part
The Colab Notebooks contain code for implementing and experimenting with different GAN architectures.

### Key Steps:
1. Implement a Vanilla GAN to generate adversarial MNIST images.
2. Explore different loss functions and their impact on GANs.
3. Create adversarial images using a trained CNN model.
4. Analyze and compare the results of various GAN implementations.

## Instructions
